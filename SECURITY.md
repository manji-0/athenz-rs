# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.
If that is not available, open an issue and clearly mark it as security-sensitive.

We will acknowledge reports and work on a fix as quickly as possible.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release and the `main` branch are supported with security fixes.
